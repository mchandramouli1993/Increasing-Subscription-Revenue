Corporate Social Responsibility, Investor
Behaviors, and Stock Market Returns:
Evidence from a Natural Experiment
in China

ABSTRACT. This article studies how financial investors
respond to firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR)
performance in terms of their investing behaviors, and
how such behaviors change contingent on an event that
provokes their attention and concerns to CSR. Using the
melamine contamination incident in China as a natural
experiment, it is found that neither the individual inves-
tors’ nor the institutional investors’ behaviors are influ-
enced by firms’ CSR performance before the incident.
Nevertheless,
institutional
investors’ behaviors are significantly influenced by firms’
CSR performance that exceeds a certain threshold. Fur-
thermore, such an effect diminishes for a better CSR
performance. In comparison, the authors do not find any
effects of CSR performance on individual investors, either
before the event or after the event. Finally, firms’ per-
formance and investors’ behaviors jointly affect firms’
stock returns after the event but not before the event. This
article reconciles the mixed findings in the literature on
the effect of firms’ CSR performance on their financial
performance by showing that such an effect exists in a
contingent manner. Furthermore, the authors show that a
too low or a too high CSR performance could lead to
undesirable responses from investors. Therefore, managers
should pay attention to optimizing firms’ CSR activities.

Introduction

The reconciliation of a ﬁrm’s commercial success,

and its
and respect
society, and the natural

responsibilities

environment, has greatly grabbed the attention of
researchers since the 1980s. The extant literature in
this ﬁeld – the so-called corporate social responsi-
bility (CSR) – supports the notion that going beyond
proﬁt maximization and caring about the interests of
society, consumers, and employees are beneﬁcial to a
ﬁrm’s long-term performance in operations (e.g.,
Luo and Bhattacharya, 2009; McWilliams and Siegel,
2001; Pava and Krausz, 1996; Solomon and Hansen,
1985; Whetten et al., 2002).

formance on the ﬁnancial market report mixed

a
positive relationship (e.g., Posnikoff, 1997), some
discover a negative relationship (e.g., Wright and
Ferris, 1997), and others ﬁnd no relationship (e.g.,
Teoh et al., 1999). One plausible explanation for
the discrepant results is the time frame of CSR
activities: the costs of CSR are immediate, whereas
many of
its beneﬁts are not realized promptly;
therefore, investors with different timeframes value
ﬁrms’ CSR performance differently (Tsoutsoura,
2004).

Since a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance is directly
affected by investors’ buying and selling behaviors, to
understand how investors perceive CSR is critical to
understanding the relationship between a ﬁrm’s CSR
activities and its ﬁnancial performance. Nevertheless,
despite its importance,
this area is quite under-
explored. In this article, such a relationship via the
event-study approach is investigated. Speciﬁcally,

is
hypothesized that CSR only inﬂuences investors in
a contingent manner, i.e., the inﬂuence is mani-
fested only after an event and not before it. It is
also proposed that
the inﬂuence of CSR on
investors varies depending on the type of investors
(institutional investors versus individual investors).
Finally, the authors postulate that a ﬁrm’s CSR
performance affects its short-term ﬁnancial perfor-
mance after the event but not before it.

Using China’s melamine contamination incident
in 2008 as a natural experiment, the authors ﬁnd
strong support for the above hypotheses. In addition,
the authors detect two effects of CSR on investors’
behaviors ex post the event. Speciﬁcally, a ﬁrm’s
CSR performance positively affects investors’ buy-
ing and selling of its stocks only when the CSR
performance exceeds a lower bound. On the other
hand, the effect of CSR demonstrates a diminishing
pattern on investors’ behaviors.

This article makes three contributions. First, it
enhances our understanding of the role played by
CSR in investors’ behaviors at large, which is found
to be contingent on investors’ attention to ﬁrms’
CSR performance, which was triggered by a CSR
event. Hence, this article offers one explanation that
reconciles the contradicting ﬁndings in the literature
regarding ﬁrms’ CSR and ﬁnancial performance.
Second, this article documents the varied responses
of different investors to CSR. It is found that insti-
tutional investors are more sensitive to CSR per-
formance than individual

Literature review

This article is related to two streams of literature.
The ﬁrst stream is on the effect of CSR on invest-
ment performance, which is an interesting topic to
both practitioners and academia. An extant literature
uses social screens as main ﬁlters for evaluating CSR
performance. Given the tension between modern
portfolio theory and CSR performance (Derwall
et al., 2005; Kurtz, 2005), the relationship between
investment strategies and CSR is a critical
issue.
There are two competing theories explaining the
impact of incorporating social screens in investors’
decisions. On the one hand, arguments based on
portfolio theory argue that
the construction of
portfolios on the basis of a restricted universe of
stocks will compromise the beneﬁts of full diversi-
ﬁcation (Rudd, 1981). Furthermore, the additional
costs of monitoring social performance will also
cause lower returns. Accordingly, investment port-
folios based on CSR (the so-called SRI funds)
should exhibit underperformance relative to con-
ventional peers. On the other hand, proponents of
socially responsible investments argue that
social
screens are ﬁlters to select ﬁrms with higher quality
of management. Consequently, portfolios composed
of
from
improved performance in the long run (e.g., Hill
et al., 2007). Empirical studies ﬁnd no statistical
differences between the average performance of SRI
and conventional funds in the U.S.1 (e.g., Benson
et al. 2006; Hamilton et al., 1993). The empirical
evidence for international markets provides mixed
ﬁndings about underperformance of SRI funds rel-
ative to conventional ones (e.g., Bauer et al. 2005,
2006, 2007; Jones et al., 2008; Kreander et al.,
2005).

socially responsible stocks will beneﬁt

This article is also related to the studies on ﬁrms’
motivation to conduct CSR activities. Traditional
economic studies suggest that CSR is not part of
managerial duties and may cause cash ﬂow waste
and, consequently, lead to a violation of the ﬁdu-
ciary relationship of managers with shareholders
(Friedman, 1962). Nevertheless, advocates of the
stakeholder theory argue that shareholder wealth
maximizing behavior may be in accordance with
social optimum in a framework in which well

surpluses,’’ The proponents of

functioning institutions set proper rules and ﬁscal
incentives to reconcile individual and social opti-
mum. However, that behavior does not hold in an
economic environment
riddled by conﬂicts of
interest, agency costs and informational asymmetries
in which weak or missing institutions cannot per-
form their task. Freeman (1984) argues that CSR
may be the optimal strategy for minimizing trans-
action costs with stakeholders
(e.g., creditors,
employees, suppliers, customers, and the society at
large) in such a framework. Tirole (2001) points out
that the concept of stakeholder value recognizes that
corporate activity may create negative externalities
which need to be counterbalanced, either by insti-
tutional rules or by corporations themselves. In such
a scenario, the ultimate value of shareholders’ wealth
may be linked to ‘‘maximizing the sum of various
stakeholder
the
stakeholder theory argue that sometimes the interests
of other important stakeholders should supersede the
interests of a ﬁrm’s
in managerial
decision-making, even if this reduces the present
value of a ﬁrm’s cash ﬂows (Clarkson, 1995; Don-
aldson and Preston, 1995; Mitchell et al., 1997;
Wood and Jones, 1995). Empirically, Solomon and
Hansen (1985) observe that costs of CSR in terms of
higher care for stakeholders are more than com-
pensated by positive changes in employee morale
and productivity; Pava and Krausz (1996) and
Preston and O’Bannon (1997) ﬁnd that positive
synergies exist between corporate performance and
good stakeholder relationships; Ruf et al. (2001)
highlight a positive link among CSR, growth in
sales, and returns on sales. Considering the costs and
beneﬁts of CSR activities, their relationship with
corporate performance becomes an empirical ques-
tion, but the results are mixed (Margolis and Walsh,
2003).

Empirical procedure

In this section, the empirical procedure that is used
in this study is introduced. ‘‘Background’’ section
introduces the industry background of the natural
experiment. ‘‘Data’’ section explains the sources of
our data. ‘‘Event study, abnormal returns, and net
order ﬂow’’ section details the event-study meth-
odology.

Background

The melamine contamination incident in China
It was secret that had been kept from the public: raw
milk producers had been adding melamine, a chem-
ical rich in nitrogen, into milk to boost the detected
amount of nitrogen (as a proxy for protein content)
in milk quality tests. Owing to the shortage of raw
milk caused by the fast-growing demand for dairy
products, dairy-product manufacturers in China had
remained silent to the issue to compete for the raw
milk they needed. Melamine is lethal to infants, and is
also harmful to adults if a large dose is taken. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration allows amounts less
than 2.5 parts per million in adult foods and zero in
infant foods.

The melamine contamination incident broke
out on September 11, 2008, when Sanlu Corpora-
tion, one of China’s largest dairy manufacturers,
announced that its products on sale had been con-
taminated by melamine. Sanlu immediately recalled all
of its products from the market. Since melamine was
added to raw milk, consumers suspected that all kinds
of dairy products could potentially be contaminated.
The fear was conﬁrmed 2 days later when products
of 22 brands (with total market shares exceeding 90%
in liquid milk and 50% in powdered milk) were found
to contain melamine (Chao, 2008). Later, in-depth
reports revealed that the top management of the dairy
companies involved knew that their products con-
tained melamine long before the incident, but they
were afraid that product recalls would heavily hurt
their reputations and market
shares. These dairy
companies were accused of poorly managing their
supply chain system, losing quality control, inten-
tionally delaying product recall, and hiding recall from
public. Hence, the melamine contamination incident
is a typical CSR event.

From the investors’ perspective, the consequence
of the incident was severe. Sanlu went bankrupt
5 months following the incident, and all the publicly
traded dairy companies
that were found faulty
experienced a drastic decline (at least 30%) in stock
prices.

CSR in China
The ﬁrst CSR report in China was released by Shell
China in 1999. Since then, the number of public-
traded companies that voluntarily report their CSR

activities has been growing (Kolk et al. 2007). With
rapid economic growth in China, the issue of how
to balance economic growth and social development
is receiving growing attention by the general public,
media, as well as government agencies at the various
levels. CSR has also gained growing awareness
among Chinese entrepreneurs. According to a sur-
vey of 4586 Chinese companies conducted by the
China Enterprise Survey System in 2007, nearly 55%
of respondents said they have become familiar with
CSR activities. Another survey conducted by the
Social Science Academy of China in 2008 suggests
that the majority of investors in China care about
ﬁrms’ CSR activities. Shenzhen Stock Exchange,
one of the two stock exchanges in China, encour-
ages listed companies to regularly disclose their CSR
activities. The other stock exchange, Shanghai Stock
Exchange, launched a new CSR index in 2009.

Data

The authors sample all the ﬁrms listed on China’s
stock markets with sales over 10 billion RMB
(approximately 1.5 billion USD) in the 2007 ﬁscal
year. The initial sample includes 118 ﬁrms. Three
ﬁrms have subsequently been dropped given that
their shares were in trading suspension and there
were no trading activities during the period of study.
To mitigate sample selection bias, one dairy industry
ﬁrm was also dropped. Our ﬁnal sample consists of
114 ﬁrms. Trades and quotes data come from the
RESSET Financial Database. The database
is
developed and maintained by Beijing Gildata RES-
SET Data Tech and is publicly available. Other
information collected from the RESSET Financial
Database includes market capitalization, daily return,
percentage of shares held by mutual funds, and other
ﬁnancial variables.

The authors measured ﬁrms’ CSR performance in
2007 using the CSR scores compiled in 2008 by
Southern Weekend, China’s leading weekly newspa-
per targeting emerging middle-class readers with
over 1.4 million circulation (Southern Weekend is the
only news agency that had exclusively interviewed
the U.S. President Barrack Obama during his 2009

to China.), A detailed description of

visit
the
methodology used by Southern Weekend is provided
in Appendix B.

Out of the 114 ﬁrms in our sample, 86 ﬁrms were
rated by Southern Weekend with a CSR score, and the
remaining 28 ﬁrms were not rated. In Table I, sum-
mary statistics of the key ﬁnancial measures for the two
groups are presented. A between-group t-test indi-
cates that there are signiﬁcant differences between the
ﬁrms with CSR scores and those without CSR scores
in terms of the fundamental measures such as total
market capitalization, sales revenues, and return on
equity. Hence, the authors control for the effects of
heterogeneity in ﬁrms’ fundamental characteristics in
the following regression tests.

Event study, abnormal returns, and net order ﬂow

The authors use event-study methodology to
investigate how CSR affects investors’ behaviors and
stock prices before and after the melamine contam-
ination incident. The event study was ﬁrst proposed
by Fama et al. (1969), and since then it has been
widely used in the ﬁelds of economics, ﬁnance,
accounting, and marketing (for more information
regarding the event study, please refer to MacKinlay
(1997) for a summary). Described below is how the
event study for this study is employed.

The authors begin with the analysis by deﬁning
the event day and the related periods for our study.
The event day (T0) is the ﬁrst trading day after
September 11, 2008, when the melamine contami-
nation incident was made public nationally. The
estimation window is the period over which how a
stock normally relates to the market is estimated.
Information in this window serves as a control con-
dition; the event window is the period over which the
investors’ response to the event is studied. A 22-day
post-event window is used in this study since there
are 22 trading days in one calendar month. For
comparison purposes, a 22-day pre-event window is
also chosen. As a robust check, the authors also use
event windows of different lengths (estimate win-
dows are changed accordingly), and the results are
similar.

The authors obtain the cumulative abnormal returns
(CAR) and the cumulative abnormal net order ﬂow
(CANOF) for each ﬁrm in the sample for the pre-
event and post-event windows, respectively. The
two variables are the main variables of
interest.
Speciﬁcally, CAR is the cumulative change in a
stock price across the event window that accounts
for all the effects resulting from both industry and
market-wide inﬂuences. CAR measures the overall
ﬁnancial market responses to the event. CANOF
measures investors’ cumulative net cash ﬂow into (or
out of) a ﬁrm’s stocks during the event window by
investors. Thus, CANOF measures investors’ trading
activities: a positive (negative) CANOF suggests that
investors buy (sell) one stock over other stocks in the
market in the event window.

The authors calculate the CAR and CANOF for

stock i over an event window [TS, TE] as follows:

CARi ¼

CANOFi ¼

X

TE

ARi; t;

ANOFi; t;

t¼TS
X

TE

t¼TS

ð1Þ

ð2Þ

where TS and TE are the starting and ending days
for pre-event win-
of the window, respectively:
dow, TS = T0 - 22, and TE = T0 - 1;
for post-
event window, TS = T0, and TE = T0 + 22. ARi,t
(ANOFi,t) is the abnormal returns (the abnormal
net order ﬂow) for stock i at trading day t. The
procedures on how to derive ARi,t and ANOFi,t
are detailed in Appendix A.

Since the authors cannot directly observe investor
types, i.e., individual investors versus institutional
investors, the authors follow Lee and Radhakrishna
(2000) and assume that small (large) trades are orig-
inated mostly by individual (institutional) investors.
Accordingly, the authors compute CANOFSmall and
CANOFLarge based on the volume per trade: orders
less than 100,000 are categorized as small, orders
between 100,000 and 500,000 are categorized
as medium, and orders greater than 500,000 are

large. Hence, CANOFSmall

and
categorized as
CANOFLarge measure the behaviors of individual
and institutional investors, respectively.

Analysis and results

Model speciﬁcations

To examine and compare the CANOF for different
ﬁrms around the event, the following speciﬁcation is
used:

where, Di is a dummy variable indicating whether
or not ﬁrm i was given a CSR score by Southern

Southern Weekend, multiplied by 100 to scale the

includes two controlling variables: Ln(size)i is the

The speciﬁcation in Eq. 3 has two merits. First, it
allows
the comparison between ﬁrms with and
without assigned CSR scores, which is reﬂected
through the estimate of Di. If Di

investors demonstrate similar behaviors to the stocks
of ﬁrms with and without CSR ratings. Second, the

speciﬁcation allows the comparison among ﬁrms
with different CSR performance, and tests whether a
diminishing return of CSR performance is present.
Since a single regression that tests the presence and
the linear and nonlinear effects of CSR performance
on investors’ behaviors is conducted, the estimation
is more efﬁcient than running two separate regres-
sions of (4) and (5) (Kennedy 2003).

The speciﬁcation in Eq. 3 can also be used to
test
the inﬂuence of CSR performance on the
behaviors of individual investors, as well as those of
institutional investors, by replacing CANOF with
CANOFSmall or CANOFLarge.

The relationship between CAR and CANOF is

examined via the following empirical model:

two controlling variables: Ln

(size)i and Ln(M/B)i. Ln(size)i is as deﬁned above
and Ln(M/B)i is the logarithm of ﬁrm i’s market
capitalization divided by its book value. In keeping
with asset-pricing literature (e.g., Acharya and
Pedersen, 2005; Fama and French, 1992), Ln(size)i
and Ln(M/B)i are introduced to control
for the
idiosyncratic differences across different ﬁrms.

The speciﬁcation in Eq. 6 allows us to test three
potential effects of ﬁrms’ CSR performance on their
ﬁnancial performance in a short period of time before
and after the event. The ﬁrst effect is the indirect
effect, which is through investors’ behaviors, i.e.,
CANOFSmall and CANOFLarge. The second effect is
the direct effect, which is examined to establish both the
presence and the linear and nonlinear impacts of CSR.
The third effect is the interaction effect of CSR perfor-
mance and investors’ behaviors. Table II presents
summary statistics of the variables under investigation.
The authors plot the average CANOFSmall and
CANOFLarge for the ﬁrms with and without a CSR
score, respectively, during the event window in
Figure 1. The authors ﬁnd that there are no signif-
icant differences between the group means of ﬁrms
with and without a CSR score during the event

window for CANOFSmall and CANOFLarge, respec-
tively.2 The reason is that in the group of ﬁrms with
a CSR score, the effect on the ﬁrms by a high CSR
score offsets that on the ﬁrms by a low CSR score,
resulting in the insigniﬁcant difference in the mean
comparison.

that CSR performance positively affects investors’
buying behaviors only when the CSR score is above
a certain level; otherwise,
investors have greater
interests in buying stocks of ﬁrms without CSR
scores
receiving low
CSR scores. This suggests that ﬁrms with poor CSR
performance alienate their investors. In fact, the
minimum CSR performance needed for a positive
effect can be computed, which is given by
Þ ¼ 21:23. A 95% conﬁdence interval
[16.69,
for
25.77]. In addition, a negative second-order effect of
CSR performance is found: (^c3 = -0.244, p < 1%).
The negative second-order effect suggests a dimin-
ishing marginal effect for CSR activities on inves-
tors’ behaviors. This ﬁnding is consistent with the
literature,
implying that investors tend to be less
responsive to high CSR performance, as they worry
it will undermine ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performance
(Wright and Ferris, 1997).

The above table reports the cross-sectional regression results of cumulative abnormal net order-ﬂows before and after the
event date. The results of Panels A and B are based on different event windows. The dependent variables are CANOF,
CANOFSamll and CANOFLarge, respectively, all of which are deﬁned in the text. D is a dummy variable. If the ﬁrm
belongs to the scored sample, D = 1; If the ﬁrm belongs to the non-scored sample, then D = 0. CSR is the CSR score of
sample stocks. CSR2 is the square of score. Ln(size)i is the natural logarithm of market capitalization (prices times shares
outstanding) of ﬁrm i on June 30, 2008. InstiHolding is the percentage of shares held by mutual funds to total tradable
shares on June 30, 2008. Robust standard errors (adjusted by sample size) are reported in parentheses.

comparison, ﬁrms’ CSR performance signiﬁcantly
affects the behaviors of institutional investors in a
similar fashion, as in the regression of CANOF. The
regression also yields a minimum CSR performance
required to have a positive effect on institutional
investors. Finally, it is found that CSR performance
does not inﬂuence either type of investors in the
pre-event window.3

the results

Considered together,

in Table III
suggest that the effects of CSR are evident only after
the incident, and that such effects are only on the
institutional investors for CSR performance above a
certain threshold.

Regression of CAR on CANOF and CSR
Table IV presents estimation results for the inﬂuence of
CSR and investors’ behaviors on stocks’ cumulative

abnormal returns (CAR), as speciﬁed in Eq. 6. Only in
the post-event window was found a negative effect for
Di (^a3 = -0.440, p < 5%) and a positive effect for
CSRi (^a4 = 1.899, p < 5%). These ﬁndings imply that
the direct effect of ﬁrms’ CSR performance on their
ﬁnancial performance is also contingent on the event.
Furthermore, in the post-event window, signiﬁ-
cant interactions between CANOFSmall and CSR
variables, as well as between CANOFLarge and CSR
variables are found (please refer to Table IV for spe-
ciﬁc estimates). These results suggest that the effect of
CSR on a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance is greater
when the investors buy more volume of shares and
the CSR score of the pertinent ﬁrm is higher.

What is the impact of increasing CSR perfor-
mance by one point? The authors ﬁnd that such a
marginal impact of an improved CSR performance

is more likely to come from the behaviors of insti-
tutional investors. Hence, the regression disentangles
the effects of ﬁrms’ CSR performance on their
ﬁnancial performance, which otherwise are difﬁcult
to discern.

Not surprisingly, the authors do not detect any
signiﬁcant effects involving CSR in the pre-event
window. Hence, the estimation results are consistent
with our predictions.

General discussion and concluding remarks

The analysis presents a case of contingent inﬂuence of
CSR on investors’ behaviors. Even though investors
in China had expressed their concerns regarding ﬁrms’
CSR activities in a recent survey by China Academy
of Social Science, the authors do not ﬁnd any signif-
icant relationship between ﬁrms’ CSR performance
and investors’ buying/selling behaviors in the pre-
event window. Nor is found any signiﬁcant difference

between investors’ behaviors on the stock of ﬁrms
with and without measured CSR performance.
Nevertheless, in the post-event window, signiﬁcant
effects of CSR on investors’ behaviors are detected.
These ﬁndings suggest that investors’ concerns for
CSR could be inﬂuenced by the mounting attention
due to some events. In other words, CSR inﬂuences
investors’ buying/selling behaviors at least in a short
period of time after the event, but not before it.

Further analysis reveals that institutional investors,
rather than individual investors, are more subject to the
inﬂuence of CSR. Speciﬁcally, through the separate
regressions on the behaviors of different types of inves-
tors, the authors ﬁnd that institutional investors tend to
care more about the CSR performance of listed ﬁrms
than that of individual investors as they differentiated
their investment strategies between ﬁrms with different
CSR performances. This ﬁnding is consistent with lit-
erature on socially responsible investment (Solomon
et al., 2002; Sparkes and Cowton, 2004) and offers
important managerial insights to managers, i.e., that

Corporate Social Responsibility, Investor Behaviors, and Stock Market Returns

137

institutional investors play a critical role in encouraging
and promoting CSR activities.

The authors also ﬁnd that investors favor the stocks
of those ﬁrms’ whose CSR performance is within a
certain range. A low CSR score suggests a high possi-
bility of crisis a ﬁrm may encounter, which will lead to a
loss for investors. In comparison, a high CSR score may
imply that a ﬁrm might potentially overinvest in CSR
activities and could undermine its short-term ﬁnancial
performance. These ﬁndings of this study shed light on
how ﬁrms choose the input to optimize their CSR
activities from the perspective of ﬁnancial performance,
an area that gradually attracts ﬁrms’ attention (Peloza,
2006; Porter and Kramer, 2002).

This study offers two important implications for
managers. First, it is shown that institutional inves-
tors react to the CSR-related scandal more aggres-
sively than individual investors, which rationalizes
the development of SRI-oriented funds. This is
because SRI-oriented funds can do a better job
monitoring ﬁrms’ CSR performance relative to
common individual investors, which to some extent
helps to prevent catastrophic consequences such as
BP’s oil leakage. Second, it is shown that there is an
optimal CSR performance range and that
the
ﬁnancial market can efﬁciently recognize this range
and price stocks based on it. This result provides a
rationale for optimizing CSR activities.

One limitation of this study is that the authors do
not have direct access to investors’ perception of, and
attention to, CSR before and after the event. In view
of this, the authors have to use investors’ behaviors as a
proxy, and measure the change of such activities
caused by the event. On the other hand, owing to the
methodology that is used, the authors only assess the
impact of CSR performance in the short
term.
Therefore, how long the effects of CSR performance
can last needs to be explored in future research.

The derivation of ANOFi,t

Based on the literature on market microstructure
(Beber et al. 2009; Campbell et al. 2009; Chordia
et al., 2000, 2001, 2002; Hvidkjaer, 2008), the au-
thors use the CANOF for each ﬁrm in the sample
for the pre-event and post-event windows to mea-
sure investors’ behaviors regarding investing in a
stock or a portfolio. In order to calculate CANOF,
the authors need to compute the net order ﬂow
(NOF). NOFs for each stock and each day are
computed via the following steps:

1. Several ﬁlters to eliminate trades and quotes
that are non-standard or likely to contain
errors to insure data integrity are used.4

2. The trade records before the open and after the
close in accordance with the convention of the
market microstructure literature are eliminated.
3. The algorithm proposed by Lee and Ready
(1991) to sign each trade as being initiated
by a buyer or a seller is employed.

138

Maobin Wang et al.

4. One trade each to a size category (small,
medium, and large) for order ﬂow speciﬁed
in RMB is assigned. Cutoffs of order ﬂows
(in RMB) are as
less than
100,000 are small, orders between 100,000
and 500,000 are medium, and orders no less
than 500,000 are large. This procedure results
in a set of daily order ﬂow series for each
stock: small, medium, or large buys/sells.

follows: orders

5. NOF as the sum of all buyer-initiated vol-
ume minus the sum of all seller-initiated vol-
ume in the same trading day is computed.
Likewise, NOF of small trades and NOF of
large trades are computed accordingly.

6. Following Lee and Radhakrishna (2000), NOF
of small (large) trades as the measure of the
investing behaviors of individual (institutional)
investors is labeled, since small (large) trades are
mostly initiated by individual
(institutional)
investors (Lee and Radhakrishna 2000).

The market portfolio is composed of all the stocks
in our data set, and the NOF to the stock market as a
whole on each day is the sum of the NOF of each
stock. The expected NOF, E[NOF], is deﬁned as
the size-weighted NOF. With E[NOF], abnormal
net order ﬂow (ANOF) can be constructed as fol-
lows:

ANOFi; t ¼ NOFi; t   Ei; t NOF


CAPi; t

¼ NOFi; t   NOFMkt; t  Weighti; t

CAPi; t

:

where NOFi,t and Ei,t[NOF] are the total net
order ﬂow and expected net order ﬂow of stock
i on day t, respectively. CAPi,t is the tradable capi-
talization of stock i on day t. Ei,t[NOF] is com-
puted as NOFMkt,t * Weighti,t, where NOFMkt,t is
the total net order ﬂow of the stock market port-
folio, which includes all of our sample stocks, on
day t, and Weighti,t is the percentage of the trad-
able capitalization of stock i in the market portfolio
on day t. If ANOF is positive (negative), there is a
higher proportion of cash ﬂow into (out of) a
stock than is the weight of this stock in the market
portfolio. Obviously, the measure of ANOF intui-
tively reﬂects investors’ intent to invest.

CANOF also reﬂects an investor’s cash ﬂow into
(out of) a stock during a speciﬁc period. A positive
(negative) CANOF suggests investors tend to buy
(sell) a certain stock over other stocks in the market
during a speciﬁc period. Likewise, measures of
cumulative abnormal net order ﬂow of small trades
(CANOFSmall) and cumulative abnormal net order
ﬂow of large trades (CANOFLarge) can be computed
accordingly to reﬂect
investing of
individual and institutional investors.

Appendix B: How Southern Weekend
compiled CSR scores

The CSR ranking system by Southern Weekend is a
simpliﬁed version of the widely acknowledged CSR
criteria developed by KLD Research & Analytics,
Inc., which contain eight domains: community,
corporate governance, diversity, employee relations,
environment, human rights, product quality, and
controversial business issues. As a ﬁrst attempt in
China, Southern Weekend tried to balance a ﬁrm’s
social responsibility and its economic responsibility.
It also took public support into consideration in
compiling its CSR rankings.

Based on the following four domains, Southern
Weekend calculated the weighted average CSR score
for each ﬁrm. The weight and detailed items in each
domain are given as follows:

1. Social responsibility: 40%, including product
safety and services quality (10%), environ-
mental protection (10%),
relations
(10%) and communication relations (10%);

labor

2. Operating performance: 30%, including sales

(10%), equity (10%) and net proﬁt (10%);

3. Social contribution: 20%, including taxation
(5%) and R&D

(10%), employee beneﬁts
expenses (5%);

4. Public image: 10%,
poll support (10%).

including public online

Corporate Social Responsibility, Investor Behaviors, and Stock Market Returns

139

For each domain, the ﬁrm with the best perfor-
mance received a score of 100, and the rest received
scores based on their relative performance to the
best-performed ﬁrm. Southern Weekend compiled a
comprehensive CSR score for each ﬁrm using the
weights given above.

Notes

See Renneboog et al. (2008) for a comprehensive

survey of the literature on SRI.
2 The test results are available from the author upon
request.
3 Considering the high correlation between ﬁrm’s size
and its CSR score (q = 0.674), a multicollinearity con-
cern exists when using the CSR and Ln(size) jointly as
independent variables. The authors implement the two-
step regression model to address this concern. In the ﬁrst
step, the authors regress CANOF (or CANOFSmall and
CANOFLarge) on Ln(size) and InstiHolding, then get the
regression residual term. In the second step, the authors
regress the residual on dummy variable Di and the inter-
section of dummy variable Di and CSR, CSR2. The au-
thors ﬁnd the signiﬁcant effects of CSR, CSR2, as
predicted by the article (results are available upon request).
4 Trades are omitted if they have negative trade prices
or involve a price change (since the prior trade) greater
than 10% in absolute value. Quotes are deleted if the
bid or ask is non-positive, the bid–ask spread is nega-
tive, the change in the bid or ask price is greater than
10% in absolute value, or the bid or ask depth is non-
positive. Because Chinese stock markets are computer-
ized limit-order markets, the sequence of outstanding
quotes have been matched with the sequence of trades
when being displayed to the public.
